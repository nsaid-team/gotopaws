TomToml!  (aka Tommy)  Approximately, 1 1/2 yrs old, 15 lbs and 14Ã¢Â€Â tall at the shoulder.  TomTom has a full tail and button ears.  He is a sweet, loving, smart and handsome young man who loves to play with his foster siblings and chew on bones.  TomTom transitioned into his foster family very easily and is Ã¢Â€Âœgetting schooledÃ¢Â€Â in the ways of dog etiquette by his older foster siblings.  He takes the corrections well and shows the proper respect.  His favorite place to be is next to his human companion, his favorite position to sleep is on his back.  TomTom was picked up as a stray in Austin, Texas.  The wonderful folks at the Austin Animal Center noticed he had a limp and investigated.  X-rays revealed that his right rear hip was in an abnormal position.  They feel he was probably hit by a car and did not get the proper attention.  The animal center made sure TomTom had surgery to help alleviate the pain and physical therapy to get him back on all fours. Now that TomTom is in a foster home, he continues to go to physical therapy twice a week and works with his foster mom daily to get the strength back in that leg.  TomTomÃ¢Â€Â™s physical therapist is pleased with his progress but warns that he will probably always have a bit of a limp. TomTom does not let that slow him down at all!  He loves to tear around the back yard either chasing or being chased by Ã¢Â€ÂœArchieÃ¢Â€Â his Yorkie foster brother.  Tommy and Archie play tug and fetch together, eat out of the same bowl, and fuss at each other like true brothers.  TomTom is crate trained, house trained and does well in a car.  We are working on walking nicely on a leash without pulling.  He takes treats very gently and will run and get in his crate at the sound of the treat bag.  After a long hard day of play, he settles down and sleeps quietly in his crate all night.  TomTom is full of young terrier energy and would love an active family to play and snuggle with.  TomTom is UTD on all shots, neutered and on heartworm prevention.  Apply to adopt him today and heÃ¢Â€Â™ll pack up his toys to come home.

This spunky little gal is looking for a family to call her own, and she's ready to give you all the love she has.  There are two sides to Nico:  the calm snuggly girl and then the active playful girl.  She loves all people although she will initially bark at new people.  She's fostered in a home with other dogs and gets along very well with all of them.  She's also got 3 2-legged kids under the age of , and she gets along fabulously with them as well.  She has seriously never met a stranger.\n\nIn the evenings, Nico likes to sit in your lap, on your shoulders, under the covers in your bed.  Basically, wherever you are, she would like to be...or she'd like to be perched on the back of the couch to see where you may be from a distance.  She is crate-trained, and she's almost fully potty-trained.  She needs a little reminder when taken outside to do her business, but she's been doing fairly well.  She walks well on leash, so she may actually be used to a former apartment/condo lifestyle.\n\nFor the side of Nico that is active, she would do well with a home that can offer her some physical activity and possibly some additional training.  She is highly treat/food motivated, which bodes well for increasing her bag of tricks.  Her foster family thinks she'd actually make a great agility dog for a number of reasons including her ability to climb the ladder to the kids' playscape to join them in the 'house'.  She has tried to dig under a gate at her foster home twice now, so a home without a doggie door is an absolute must as she may be a flight risk.  Upon her first escape, she ran across the street and jumped into the driver seat of her neighbor who was leaving for work.  The neighbor was quite impressed with what a lover she is, but no one is impressed with her jail break antics :).\n\nAdoption fee is $200.\nIf you are interested in adopting, please read our Frequently Asked Questions before completing the adoption application.\nThe application and general information can also be found at: www.smallchancerescue.com."},"sex":{"$t":"F"},"age":{"$t":"Young"},"size":{"$t":"S"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"TX1148"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-04-23T02:38:03Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/1/?bust=1429756682&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/1/?bust=1429756682&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/1/?bust=1429756682&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/1/?bust=1429756682&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/1/?bust=1429756682&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/2/?bust=1429756682&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/2/?bust=1429756682&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/2/?bust=1429756682&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/2/?bust=1429756682&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/2/?bust=1429756682&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/3/?bust=1429756683&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/3/?bust=1429756683&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/3/?bust=1429756683&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/3/?bust=1429756683&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31758203/3/?bust=1429756683&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"31758203"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"specialNeeds"},{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"housetrained"}]},"breeds":{"breed":{"$t":"Chihuahua"}},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Cody"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"info@smallchancerescue.com"},"zip":{"$t":"78766"},"city":{"$t":"Austin"},"fax":{},"address1":{"$t":"P.O.

While we haven't been able to put all the pieces together on his puzzle prior to coming into our group from the shelter, we do know that he was shuffled around quite a bit over the years.  He is very timid in nature, so if you're looking for a dog that will throw himself into your arms and greet you with lots of tail wags and kisses, he's not the guy for you.  Any affection from Cody must be earned, and an adopter will have to be up for the challenge and the time involved in doing so.  Having been with his foster family now for a couple months, he is still reserved and prefers only to cuddle up at bedtime. \n\nCody will lay down on the floor about 10 feet from the couch if his foster mom is sitting down and cry for her, but when his foster mom goes to pick him up, he darts off :).  He will follow her anywhere in the house to be where she is, but he's not interested in having her pick him up.  If she does manage to catch him, he will sit nicely on the couch, sometimes in her lap or sometimes on the far end.  At night-time, however, he will always go into his foster parents' bedroom and will finally stand still to allow you to pick him up to put him on the bed.  Unlike any chihuahua that his foster mom has ever had or fostered, he does not burrow under blankets!  At night, he will sleep on the bed, and sometimes he'll get close enough to let his foster mom rest her hand on him.  However, if you move in bed, he will scurry away again.  He seems to view the bedroom as a safe spot and enjoys lounging on the bed while his family (2-legged parents and their 2-legged kids) get ready for work/school in the morning.  He gets along well with the other dogs in his foster home although high energy dogs tend to scare him.  Based on what we do know about his history, we do think he will likely always be a timid little man, so while a lot of work with him will likely gain a loyal and happy guy...he will likely never be an outgoing, social guy.\n\nCody's teeth were severely neglected, but he received a dental where they removed 11 teeth.  While under, we also had an x-ray done on his upper body area as he shows some discomfort/pain in the right shoulder area since arriving at his foster home.  X-rays did not show anything abnormal, however.  Cody was displaying shrieking episodes, and after witnessing an episode, the vet now believes he has been having focal seizures.  The cause of the seizures is unknown, but based on his age, she believes it's likely a mild form of epilepsy.  Cody is on a compounded prescription and has been since the middle of April, which is working!  However, a potential adopter should note that these medications cost approximately $50/month ($600 annually), and he may be on them throughout the remainder of his life.\n\nAdoption fee is $200.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please read our Frequently Asked Questions before completing the adoption application.\nThe application and general information can also be found at: www.smallchancerescue.com."},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"S"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"TX1148"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-06-19T16:29:38Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/1/?bust=1429636842&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/1/?bust=1429636842&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/1/?bust=1429636842&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/1/?bust=1429636842&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/1/?bust=1429636842&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/2/?bust=1429754623&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/2/?bust=1429754623&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/2/?bust=1429754623&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/2/?bust=1429754623&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/2/?bust=1429754623&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/3/?bust=1429754623&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/3/?bust=1429754623&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/3/?bust=1429754623&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/3/?bust=1429754623&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31865520/3/?bust=1429754623&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"31865520"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"noCats"},{"$t":"housetrained"}]},"breeds":{"breed":{"$t":"Domestic Short Hair"}},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Vivian - Courtesy Listing"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"info@smallchancerescue.com"},"zip":{"$t":"78766"},"city":{"$t":"Austin"},"fax":{},"address1":{"$t":"P.O.

Mom got frustrated taking pictures of me because I was always sticking my tongue out. Well, when she took me to the doctor for a senior physical, she learned that I have a cleft lip. My doctor is a published feline veterinarian, and he hadn't seen that before, so his assistant took a photo and who knows, I might end up in a book someday! I'll be glad to autograph it for you if/when that happens. He also said he didn't think I was all that old, but just 'rode hard and put up wet.' So you see, I need someone who is going to give me a nice home where a laid-back, quiet kitty can get her chance to live in the lap of luxury. \n\n I adore humans and love to be petted, but I'm not nuts about cats. I might prefer to be an only, but I may not need to be. What I can tell you is that I sure don't need as many cats as there are in my foster home or in my RV. I don't really like to be picked up, but that's no big deal, now is it? \n\n Foster mom will try to get a better photo, but you can see I'm pretty cute, can't you? And maybe I even tug at your heartstrings? Are you interested in making me happy by petting me and sitting on the couch with me? Please?
